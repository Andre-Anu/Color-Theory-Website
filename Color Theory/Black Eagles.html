            <h1>Black Eagles</h1>
            <p>Nestled within the verdant halls of Garreg Mach Monastery, the Golden Deer house was a lively and eclectic group of
            students, each harboring dreams as diverse as the colors of autumn leaves. Led by the spirited and ever-curious Claude,
            the Golden Deer were a force to be reckoned with, not only on the battlefield but also in the corridors of the academy
            where laughter and mischief echoed.</p>
            
            <p>At the helm of this merry band was Claude, a charming and quick-witted archer with a penchant for unraveling mysteries.
            His leadership style was unconventional, blending strategic acumen with a laid-back demeanor that endeared him to his
            peers. The Golden Deer were not merely a house; they were a family bound by a shared love for adventure and a thirst for
            knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>Lorenz, the suave and sophisticated noble, added a touch of refinement to the group. His aspirations for a more just and
            equitable Fódlan often clashed with his aristocratic background, creating a complex character who constantly strived for
            balance.</p>

            <p>Then there was Raphael, a gentle giant with a heart of gold and muscles that could rival any seasoned warrior. His love
            for food and unwavering loyalty made him a pillar of strength within the Golden Deer, proving that true courage came in
            many forms.</p>
